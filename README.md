# CG-Mapper
CG-Mapper is a webpage that takes in a SMILES string and shows a graphical representation that can be used to coarse grain molecules. Once you have coarse grained the molecules, you can download the selection as a json file.

Visit http://thewhitelab.org/Apps/cg-map/ to use the CG-Mapper.
